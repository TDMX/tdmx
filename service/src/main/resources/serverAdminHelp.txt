TDMX server administration CLI

general command syntax:

> command-name {parameter-name=parameter-value|option}* exec

where: 

exec - executes the command entered.

multi-line parameter values can be entered if they are double-quoted. Double-quotes in a multi-line parameter value must be quoted with the backslash "\".  

you can avoid entering passwords in plain text ( echoed to the console ) by entering the parameter value "-" (minus) for any parameter, and subsequently you will be asked to enter the value of the parameter in a masked fashion.

additional special purpose commands

> help - displays this information, or usage information about a partially entered command.
> list - displays all available commands or the current parameter values of any partially entered command.
> usage - displays a description of all available commands and their parameters, or usage information about a partially entered command. 
> abort - discards a partially entered command without executing the command.
> exit - exits the program without executing any partially entered command.
